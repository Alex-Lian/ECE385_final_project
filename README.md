# ECE-385
2020 Fall             
Hello everyone. This is my ECE385 Project.             
I am fortunated to work with [Tianyu Liu](https://helloworldlty.github.io/) and I get A in this course.  BTW, our final project won the Best design award.       
If you are interested in the final project, you can visited https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISPvGTYFDGc, which is a rough demo.
